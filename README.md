# Credit Card Transaction Dashboard

This **Credit Card Transaction Dashboard** provides comprehensive insights into customer transaction data. The dashboard is built using **Power BI** and connected to a **PostgreSQL** database containing detailed credit card transaction and customer information. The dashboard helps analyze key metrics like total spending, customer acquisition costs, credit limits, and more.

## **Project Overview**

The project visualizes key data points from two main datasets:

1. **Credit Card Details** (`cc_detail`): Includes transaction data, card categories, customer behavior, and more.
2. **Customer Details** (`cust_detail`): Contains demographic information like customer age, income, marital status, etc.

### **Key Features:**
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides filters to segment data by customer demographics and transaction behavior.
- **Visual Insights**: Allows users to analyze the total transactions, annual fees, credit limits, delinquency, and other critical metrics.
- **Data Transformation**: Uses Power BIâ€™s built-in tools to clean, transform, and visualize data from a PostgreSQL database.

## **Technologies Used:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing and managing credit card and customer data.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization tool to build interactive reports and dashboards.
- **SQL**: Used to create and manage database tables and import CSV data.
